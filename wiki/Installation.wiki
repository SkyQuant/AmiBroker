If formulas folder is different then AmiBroker folder the next path in _SkyQuant.ini_ file must be changed:
{{{
  [PATH]
  TZpath=,C:\Program Files (x86)\AmiBrokerBeta\,
  ABpath=,C:\Program Files (x86)\AmiBrokerBeta\,
}}}


where
 * _TZpath_ is a part of path to TimeZones files folder
 * _ABpath_ is a part of path to SkyQuant formulas

= Open Source =

Whole solution consist of 
 * SkyQuant AFL codes
 * TmeZone files
 * Swiss Ephemeris
 * SkyQuant.dll
